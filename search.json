    "title": "Is Nebraska’s defense good enough to carry a struggling offense?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“Nebraska football is BACK…” or at least, that’s what fans hoped. But was it?\nThe 2024–2025 season told a tough story. For many die-hard Huskers fans, it was a frustrating watch: Nebraska finished 12th in the Big Ten with a 3–6 conference record, far from the “we’re back” energy that kicked off the season. Instead of rising to the top, Nebraska found itself near the bottom of the conference standings.\nYet their overall record of 7–6 and a Pinstripe Bowl win paint a different picture, one that isn’t entirely bleak, but definitely complex. And that complexity leads to the question:\nIs Nebraska’s defense good enough to carry a struggling offense?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\nlogs &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/footballlogs24.csv\")\n\nlogs &lt;- logs |&gt;\n  mutate (PointDiff = TeamScore - OpponentScore)\nnu &lt;- logs |&gt;\n  filter (Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot(nu, aes(x = reorder(Game, PointDiff), y = PointDiff, fill = PointDiff &gt; 0)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E41C38\", \"darkgray\"), labels = c(\"Loss\", \"Win\")) +\n labs(\n    x=\"Games\", \n    y=\"Point Differential for the 2024 season\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's big wins and costly losses\", \n    subtitle=\"Close wins reveal how far the defense carried Nebraska, while the losses point to \\nthe times when it simply couldn’t hold up on its own.\", \n    caption=\"Source: College Sports Reference | By Lexi Shellhammer\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Nebraska won some games comfortably, they also lost several close ones, suggesting their overall record might look worse than their competitiveness in most games. It highlights how small margins made a big difference in their season outcome.\nNebraska’s single major blowout, week 7 against Indiana, makes Nebraska look like a weak team. Without week 7 in the mix, Nebraska’s point differentials stay clustered to zero, reinforcing the idea that the Huskers were not consistently outmatched. The Huskers were consistently almost winning.\nA team that loses tight games but wins by larger margins, in this case Nebraska, often signals a defense that keeps them competitive even when the offense isn’t producing enough points. In Nebraska’s case, the defense appears to have kept most games within reach, but the offense wasn’t always able to capitalize.\nTo understand if Nebraska’s defense impacted the outcome of the game, comparing yards allowed and how those performances translated into point differential is important.\n\n\nCode\nteamsum &lt;- logs |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team)|&gt;\n  summarise(\n    AvgPointsScored = mean(TeamScore),\n    AvgPointsAllowed = mean(OpponentScore),\n    AvgPointDiff = mean(TeamScore - OpponentScore),\n    AvgYardsAllowed = mean(DefYards),   \n    AvgYardsGained  = mean(OffensiveYards),\n    TotalYardsGained = sum(OffensiveYards),\n    TotalYardsAllowed = sum(DefYards),\n    Wins = sum(Result == \"W\"),\n    Games = n(),\n    WinPct = Wins / Games\n  )\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=teamsum, aes(x=AvgYardsAllowed, y=AvgPointDiff)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=teamsum, aes(x=AvgYardsAllowed, y=AvgPointDiff), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n geom_point(data = subset(teamsum, Team == \"Nebraska\"),\n             aes(x = AvgYardsAllowed, y = AvgPointDiff),\n             color = \"#E41C38\", size = 2) + \n   geom_point(data = subset(teamsum, Team == \"Indiana\"),\n             aes(x = AvgYardsAllowed, y = AvgPointDiff),\n             color = \"#990000\", size = 2) + \n   geom_point(data = subset(teamsum, Team == \"Purdue\"),\n             aes(x = AvgYardsAllowed, y = AvgPointDiff),\n             color = \"#CFB991\", size = 2) + \n  geom_text(data = subset(teamsum, Team %in% c(\"Nebraska\", \"Indiana\", \"Purdue\")),\n            aes(x = AvgYardsAllowed, y = AvgPointDiff, label = Team),\n            hjust = -0.2, vjust = 0.5, size = 3.5) +\nexpand_limits(x = max(teamsum$AvgYardsAllowed) * 1.05) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average Defensive Yards Allowed\", \n    y=\"Point Differential\", \n    title=\"More yards allowed, means more trouble\\nfor Nebraska\", \n    subtitle=\"Once the Huskers defense started giving up more yards, the scoreboard slipped with it. \", \n    caption=\"Source: College Sports Reference | By Lexi Shellhammer\"\n    ) + \n   theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s defense held opponents to relatively few yards, but that didn’t translate into big wins, their offense wasn’t efficient enough to turn a solid defense into comfortable margins of victory.\nIndiana lead the pack with a few number of yards allowed that resulted to a high win differential that put them out on top.\nHighlighting where Nebraska ranks in both offensive production and defensive stability, reveals just how big the gap was between what their defense held opponents to and what their offense could generate in return.\n\n\nCode\nteamsum &lt;- logs |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    AvgYardsGained = mean(OffensiveYards),\n    AvgYardsAllowed = mean(DefYards)\n  )\n\nteamsum_long &lt;- teamsum |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(AvgYardsGained, AvgYardsAllowed),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Highlight = case_when(\n    Team == \"Nebraska\" ~ \"Nebraska\",\n    Team == \"Indiana\" ~ \"Indiana\",\n    Team == \"Purdue\" ~ \"Purdue\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n  ))\n\nnulong &lt;- teamsum_long |&gt;

This imbalance helps explain why Nebraska may have lost several close games. The defense performed well enough to win, but the offense couldn’t produce enough scoring opportunities.\nNebraska’s placement in the middle of the conference defensively but near the bottom offensively makes the gap even clearer, showing that while their defense kept games within reach, their offense simply couldn’t keep pace with the rest of the Big Ten.\nHow did Nebraska hold up defensively throughout the season compared to other Big Ten teams?\n\n\nCode\nbig10 &lt;- logs |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=5.217241, colour=\"red\") + \n  geom_line(data=big10, aes(x=Date, y=DefAvg, group=Team)) + \n  facet_wrap(~Team) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\", \n    y=\"Defensive Yards Allowed\", \n    title=\"Nebraska gives up ground on defense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers early defense control didn't last and it became hard to ignore.\", \n    caption=\"Source: College Sports Reference | By Lexi Shellhammer\"\n    ) + \n   theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the Big Ten, most teams showed ups and downs, defensively, but Nebraska’s trend line is especially telling. Stating off solid at the beginning of the season, their defense slipped as the season intensified. Nebraska lacked stability in their defense.\nNebraska’s defense was good, but not good enough to carry an offense that underperformed. The defense kept gaps close and gave the Huskers multiple chances to win, but without a reliable offense, the team could not keep up."

    "text": "The 2024 season for the San Jose Sharks was a tough watch for many NHL fans, but most definitely tough for Sharks fans. The Sharks ended their season with a record of 19 - 54, which was their lowest since the 1995-96 season. Struggling on the road and using and “excuse” of rebuilding, the Sharks are hungry for success.\nFinishing last in the Pacific Division and last in the Western Conference the 2023 and 2024 season, many people think they are just a bad team coming up with any reason to prove, next season will be different.\nBut, there is one question at large:\nAre the San Jose Sharks really THAT bad?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nnhlstats1967_2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"nhlstats1967_2024.csv\")\nnhl &lt;- nhlstats1967_2024 |&gt;\n  filter (season == \"2024\")\nnhl &lt;- nhl |&gt;\n  mutate(color = ifelse(tm == \"San Jose Sharks\", \"San Jose Sharks\", \"Other\"))\n\nggplot(nhl, aes(x = reorder(tm, pts), y = pts, fill = color)) +\n  geom_col() +\n \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"San Jose Sharks\" = \"#006D75\", \"Other\" = \"lightgrey\")) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"The Sharks fell to the bottom on the NHL\",\n    subtitle = \"San Jose finished the year with the fewest goals in the league, falling well below every other NHL team.\",\n    x = \"NHL Team\",\n    y = \"Goals Scored Throughout Season\",\n    fill = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sharks entered the 2024 season in full rebuild mode, with veterans traded, new names in the game and a line-up patched together. Expectations from fans were low, you cannot get much worse than last year right?\nWrong, the rebuilt team didn’t look like a team but an unraveling mess. The Sharks struggled offensively more than anything, scoring 47 goals all season wasn’t a pretty number to look at.\nIn comparison, the New York Rangers, who scored the most goals throughout the 2024 season, scored a total of 45 goals in week 12. The 2024 Stanley Cup winners, the Florida Panthers, scored a total of 48 goals in week 13. The Sharks stretched those goals across months of play, furthermore, resulting in one of the lowest scoring paces in modern NHL history.\nBreaking down their goals for and goals allowed showed a surprising amount about competitiveness and general level of play.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(nhl, aes(x = gf, y = ga, color = tm)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = subset(nhl, tm %in% c(\"San Jose Sharks\", \"New York Rangers\", \"Dallas Stars\")),\n    aes(label = tm),\n    nudge_x = 10,\n    direction = \"x\",\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 4,\n    segment.color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE  \n  ) +\n   scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"San Jose Sharks\" = \"#006D75\",\n    \"New York Rangers\" = \"#0038A8\",\n    \"Dallas Stars\" = \"#00843D\"\n  )) + \n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Exposing the defensive and offensive\\nbreakdown of the Sharks\",\n    subtitle = \"The Sharks’ combination of low scoring and high goals allowed pushed them to the\\nbottom of the league, while other teams separated themselves through stronger two-way play.\",\n    x = \"Goals Scored\",\n    y = \"Goals Allowed\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe San Jose Sharks sit far left, away from the rest of the league, low on goals scored and extremely high on goals allowed. No other team is occupies the combination the Sharks do, weak offense and weaker defense.\nMost teams cluster near the center, forming a tight and competitive middle. The Sharks, however, represent one of the highest goals allowed totals. No other team shares close quarters with the San Jose Sharks, making them not just below average, but the worst.\nTo truly see how this imbalance played out over the 2024 season, looking at the the cumulative goal difference will help demonstrate it.\n\n\nCode\nsharks &lt;- read_csv(\"sharks.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Sharks\", .before = 1)\ncanucks &lt;- read_csv(\"canucks.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Canucks\", .before = 1)\nducks &lt;- read_csv (\"ducks.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Ducks\", .before = 1)\nflames &lt;- read_csv (\"flames.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Flames\", .before = 1)\nkings &lt;- read_csv (\"kings.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Kings\", .before = 1)\nknights &lt;- read_csv (\"knights.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Knights\", .before = 1)\nkraken &lt;- read_csv (\"kraken.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Kraken\", .before = 1)\noilers &lt;- read_csv (\"oilers.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Team = \"Oilers\", .before = 1)\n\npacific_all &lt;- bind_rows(\n  sharks,\n  ducks,\n  kings,\n  canucks,\n  oilers,\n  flames,\n  knights\n) |&gt; \n  mutate (goalsdiff = GF - GA) |&gt; \n  group_by (Team) |&gt;\n    mutate(cumdiff = cumsum(goalsdiff))\n\nsharks &lt;- pacific_all |&gt; filter(Team == \"Sharks\")\nsharkslabel &lt;- sharks |&gt; filter(Date == max(Date))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=pacific_all, aes(x=Date, y=cumdiff, group=Team), , color=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_step(data=sharks, aes(x=Date, y=cumdiff, group=Team), , color=\"#006D75\") +\n\ngeom_text_repel(\n    data = sharkslabel,\n    aes(x = Date, y = cumdiff, label = Team),\n    nudge_x = 10,        \n    direction = \"y\",     \n    color = \"#006D75\",\n    size = 4,\n    segment.color = NA  \n  ) +\ngeom_point( data = sharkslabel,\n            aes(x = Date, y = cumdiff), color = \"#006D75\") +\n\n   labs(\n    title = \"The Sharks sink in the Pacific Division\",\n    subtitle = \"Looking at each games cumulative goal differential shows how San Jose seperates\\nsharply from the rest of the division as the season progresses.\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Cumulative Difference of Goals\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile other teams hover the zero line, fluctuating slightly above or below depending on match-up or slumps, the Sharks’ line immediately breaks away from the pack and never recovers throughout the season.\nThis is not just a sign of inconsistent playing, it is evident that the team is falling behind when their rebuild should be pushing them forward. As the season unfolded, the Sharks had a goal differential of more then -100, placing them in an isolated position in their conference.\nThe Sharks were consistently outscored and the cumulative effects of those losses created a season of setbacks.\nIt does take more than one or two years to “bounce back” but the 2024 season, for the San Jose Sharks, is “for the books,” but for all the wrong reasons. The Sharks ended with a 19-54 record, scoring just under 50 goals all season, and never came back. Overall, the San Jose Sharks were really “that” bad."
