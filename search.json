    "text": "Hi there! I’m Lexi, and I’m a junior studying sports media & advertising and public relations with a minor in communication studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, but I am originally from Olathe, Kansas. My Midwest roots influence all aspects of my life. I consider myself “Midwest nice” and can adapt to any weather change throughout the day! My passion for social media and content creation is the foundation of my work with the Barstool Viceroy program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I always find myself gravitating towards bold, unique creations that let me explore my passions more. As someone who grew up around sports, the culture, fanbase, and expereinces are what drive my passion for game day productions. I have always gravitated towards a sports-centered life and hope to work closely with sports post grad!"
